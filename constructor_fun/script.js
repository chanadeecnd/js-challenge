// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make 
and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the 
car in km/h;
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's 
speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5,
 and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with 
calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
